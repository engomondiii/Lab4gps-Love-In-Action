            As you enter the Lab4GPS website, you are greeted by an awe-inspiring view of Earth from space.
            The globe rotates slowly, majestically, as if you're watching it from a satellite orbiting the cosmos.
            This isn't just any digital representation of Earth; itâ€™s a living, breathing canvas where real-time human struggles and stories unfold.
