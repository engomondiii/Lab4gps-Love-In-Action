 * Professor.js
 *
 * 1. Manages the selection (random/manual) of an SDG goal.
 * 2. Displays only Professor AIâ€™s philosophical questions for that SDG.
 * 3. Calls onSDGChange(selectedId) whenever a new SDG is chosen, so Teaching.js
 *    can react and display its own data/resources.

 * NOTE: No reference to TA AI data provisioning is in this file.
 *       We keep that in Teaching.js.
